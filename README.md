# **📝 Quote Generator**

A clean and responsive JavaScript-based app that displays a new inspirational quote every time you click the **"New Quote"** button. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with a unique twist in implementation (check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niharika-hasija) 😉).
